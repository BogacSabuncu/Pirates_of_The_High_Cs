Read Me:

In PA4 I have finished doing Merchant, Pirate, Model, Kraken and exeption handling to best of my abilities. Eventhough the code compiles after few commands it gives a segmentation fault. I wasnt able to fix this simply because I ran out of time. 

I wasnt able to do the View in my previous PA3 assignment and even though I got the working file from a TA I wasnt able to integrate the view to my original code so i left that part out. It still compiles.

I have done the creating objects while run time in model but when I tried to but implement it, I got wierd compilier errors so Model has the functions but the program itself doesnt use them. 

I have not done save file again simply because I ran out of time because I was trying understand what the assignment sheet wanted me to do in other parts.

I tried to comment my code as much as possible since you probably have to look at it.

I tried my best in this assignment. Please consider that I have spent so many days and nights on this project. Please give points from your heart.
